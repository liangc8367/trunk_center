TODO:
- timer sequence (done)
- always running Executor thread
- Echo CP to send back recorded audio.

Known Issues:
- can't record the 2nd call (- extra/lingering Timer events.? CallTerm and CallData swap?)
    # after increasing flywheel to 1.5s, looks it's okay. Suspect it's because priority issue: timer thread has high
      priority than udp thread(?)
- why there's no enough CallInit and CallTerm?
- why sometimes CallTerm is ahead of CallData(last)? (CallData seq is later than CallTerm).
